This entry is especially for NEW ARMYs out there or INTERNATIONAL ARMYs who don't know their fanchants!!
  
This is important!!! So plz anticipate :blush: :smile:

***this will be a very long entry***

Only 3 title songs r included:

 BLOOD SWEAT AND TEARS

 SPRING DAY

 NOT TODAY

Let's BEGIN!!!


First let's start off with the ORDER of how you chant ALL of BTS members' names 

It is chanted as oldest to youngest.

Now, since Rap Monster is the leader of the group, his name MUST be chanted first (but he ain't the oldest- Jin is :blush: okieee)

Example:

KIM NAMJOON!

KIM SEOKJIN  !

MIN YOONGI !

JUNG HOSEOK !

PARK JIMIN !

KIM TAEHYUNG !

JEON JUNGKOOK !

BTS!!!

__

*But u can't just say the names out loud.. u have to time it to the rythm/the beat of their songs!

Try it:

Listen and wait for the right timing.. 

ARMYs chanting is pretty loud so u can just chant along 
(I can't insert songs.. idk if i can so i guess this will do  :pensive: :blush: and if u have slow connection, like me, then u can just listen to ur Music App n play the song)




*1st u gon hear JIMIN sing*

*then JUNGKOOK*

*then JIMIN again...*

After JIMIN sings: "Nae piddamnunmul~~"
